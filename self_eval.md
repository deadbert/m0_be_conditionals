# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
- Whenever you need to compare 2 or more values, and change the outcome of your code based on the comparison.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
- I'm not sure, as I learn more about conditionals and if statements I'm sure I will learn new ways to approach these tools.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
- I enjoyed working in VS code and doing some intro code work, it's always a fun time for me.
